is a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that

- allows to simulate intensity and polarization of light emerging from analytical astrophysical models as well as complex magneto-hydrodynamic simulations on various grids

- is capable to perform dust heating, -emission, -scattering, -grain alignment, line radiative transfer, and synchrotron simulations

- calculates synthetic intensity and polarization maps

- makes use of a full set of physical quantities (density, temperature, velocity, magnetic field distribution, and dust grain properties as well as different sources of radiation) as input


## Requirements

The following packages are required for the installation:

- gcc (preferred), icc, or clang++

- cmake (preferred), or ninja

- python3 (packages: *numpy*, *setuptools*)


## Installation (Linux)

Open a terminal/console and move into the POLARIS directory:
```bash
cd /YOUR/POLARIS/PATH/
```

To install POLARIS, run the installation script:
```bash
./compile.sh -f
```
For the first installation, the option `-f` is required to install the [CCfits](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/) and [cfitsio](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/) libraries.
For more information, type:
```bash
./compile.sh -h
```
POLARIS can now be executed from any newly opened terminal/console.
However, to use it in already open terminals/consoles, execute the following command to update the environmental paths:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**HINT**: Please refer to the [manual](manual.pdf) for installation on **macOS**. An installer to use POLARIS with Windows is not available yet.


## Use POLARIS
